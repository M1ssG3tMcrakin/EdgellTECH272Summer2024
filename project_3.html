        </figure>
        <p>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born on <time datetime="01-27-56">27 January 1756</time> to Leopold Mozart (<time datetime="1719">1719</time>&ndash;<time datetime=""1787>1787</time>) and Anna Maria, née Pertl (<time datetime="1720">1720</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1778">1778</time>), at Getreidegasse 9 in Salzburg. Salzburg was the capital of the Archbishopric of Salzburg, an ecclesiastic principality in the Holy Roman Empire (today in Austria). He was the youngest of seven children, five of whom died in infancy. His elder sister was Maria Anna Mozart (<time datetime="1751">1751</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1829">1829</time>), nicknamed "Nannerl". Mozart was baptised the day after his birth, at St. Rupert's Cathedral in Salzburg. The baptismal record gives his name in Latinized form, as Joannes Chrysostomus Wolfgangus Theophilus Mozart. He generally called himself "Wolfgang Amadè Mozart" as an adult, but his name had many variants.</p>
        
        <blockquote>"He often spent much time at the clavier, picking out thirds, which he was ever striking, and his pleasure showed that it sounded good. ... In the fourth year of his age his father, for a game as it were, began to teach him a few minuets and pieces at the clavier. ... He could play it faultlessly and with the greatest delicacy, and keeping exactly in time. ... At the age of five, he was already composing little pieces, which he played to his father who wrote them down." --Nannerl Mozart, Mozart's sister</blockquote>

        <p>While Wolfgang was young, his family made several European journeys in which he and Nannerl performed as child prodigies. These began with an exhibition in <time datetime="1762">1762</time> at the court of Prince-elector Maximilian III of Bavaria in Munich, and at the Imperial Courts in Vienna and Prague. A long concert tour followed, spanning three and a half years, taking the family to the courts of Munich, Mannheim, Paris, London, Dover, The Hague, Amsterdam, Utrecht, Mechelen and again to Paris, and back home via Zürich, Donaueschingen, and Munich. </p>

        <p>After finally returning with his father from Italy on <time datetime="03-13-73">13 March 1773</time>, Mozart was employed as a court musician by the ruler of Salzburg, Prince-Archbishop Hieronymus Colloredo. The composer had many friends and admirers in Salzburgand had the opportunity to work in many genres, including symphonies, sonatas, string quartets, masses, serenades, and a few minor operas. Between April and December <time datetime="1775">1775</time>, Mozart developed an enthusiasm for violin concertos, producing a series of five (the only ones he ever wrote), which steadily increased in their musical sophistication. The last three—K. 216, K. 218, K. 219—are now staples of the repertoire. In <time datetime="1776">1776</time>, he turned his efforts to piano concertos, culminating in the E♭ concerto K. 271 of early <time datetime="1777">1777</time>, considered by critics to be a breakthrough work.</p>
        
        <p>Despite these artistic successes, Mozart grew increasingly discontented with Salzburg and redoubled his efforts to find a position elsewhere. One reason was his low salary, 150 florins a year; Mozart longed to compose operas, and Salzburg provided only rare occasions for these. The situation worsened in <time datetime="1775">1775</time> when the court theatre was closed, especially since the other theatre in Salzburg was primarily reserved for visiting troupes.</p>
        
        <p>Two long expeditions in search of work interrupted this long Salzburg stay. Mozart and his father visited Vienna from <time datetime="07-14-73">14 July</time> to <time datetime="09-26-73">26 September 1773</time>, and Munich from <time datetime="12-06-74">6 December 1774</time> to March <time datetime="1775">1775</time>. Neither visit was successful, though the Munich journey resulted in a popular success with the premiere of Mozart's opera La finta giardiniera.</p>
        
        <h3><time datetime="1777">1777</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1778">78</time>: Journey to Paris</h3>
        
        <p>In August <time datetime="1777">1777</time>, Mozart resigned his position at Salzburgand on <time datetime="09-23-77">23 September</time> ventured out once more in search of employment, with visits to Augsburg, Mannheim, Paris, and Munich.</p>
        
        <p>Mozart became acquainted with members of the famous orchestra in Mannheim, the best in Europe at the time. He also fell in love with Aloysia Weber, one of four daughters of a musical family. There were prospects of employment in Mannheim, but they came to nothing, and Mozart left for Paris on <time datetime="03-14-78">14 March 1778</time> to continue his search. One of his letters from Paris hints at a possible post as an organist at  Versailles, but Mozart was not interested in such an appointment.</p>

            <p>In January <time datetime="1781">1781</time>, Mozart's opera Idomeneo premiered with "considerable success" in Munich. The following March, Mozart was summoned to Vienna, where his employer, Archbishop Colloredo, was attending the celebrations for the accession of Joseph II to the Austrian throne. For Colloredo, this was simply a matter of wanting his musical servant to be at hand (Mozart indeed was required to dine in Colloredo's establishment with the valets and cooks). </p>
            
            <blockquote>"My main goal right now is to meet the emperor in some agreeable fashion, I am absolutely determined he should get to know me. I would be so happy if I could whip through my opera for him and then play a fugue or two, for that's what he likes." --Wolfgang Mozart</blockquote>
            
            <h3>Early years</h3>
            
            <p>Mozart's new career in Vienna began well. He often performed as a pianist, notably in a competition before the Emperor with Muzio Clementi on <time datetime="12-24-1781">24 December 1781</time>, and he soon "had established himself as the finest keyboard player in Vienna". He also prospered as a composer, and in <time datetime="1782">1782</time> completed the opera Die Entführung aus dem Serail ("The Abduction from the Seraglio"), which premiered on <time datetime="06-16-82">16 July 1782</time> and achieved considerable success. The work was soon being performed "throughout German-speaking Europe", and thoroughly established Mozart's reputation as a composer.</p>
        
            <h3>Marriage and children</h3>

            </figure>
            <p>After failing to win the hand of Aloysia Weber, who was now married to the actor and artist Joseph Lange, Mozart's interest shifted to the third daughter of the family, Constanze.</p>
            <p>The courtship did not go entirely smoothly; surviving correspondence indicates that Mozart and Constanze briefly broke up in April <time datetime="1782">1782</time>, over an episode involving jealousy (Constanze had permitted another young man to measure her calves in a parlor game). Mozart also faced a very difficult task getting permission for the marriage from his father, Leopold.</p>
            <p>The couple were finally married on <time datetime="08-04-82">4 August 1782</time> in St. Stephen's Cathedral, the day before his father's consenting letter arrived in the mail. In the marriage contract, Constanze "assigns to her bridegroom five hundred gulden which ... the latter has promised to augment with one thousand gulden", with the total "to pass to the survivor". Further, all joint acquisitions during the marriage were to remain the common property of both.</p>
            <p>The couple had six children, of whom only two survived infancy.</p>
            <h3><time datetime="1782">1782</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1787">87</time></h3>
            <p>In <time datetime="1782">1782</time> and <time datetime="1783">1783</time>, Mozart became intimately acquainted with the work of Johann Sebastian Bach and George Frideric Handel as a result of the influence of Gottfried van Swieten, who owned many manuscripts of the Baroque masters. Mozart's study of these scores inspired compositions in Baroque style and later influenced his musical language, for example in fugal passages in Die Zauberflöte ("The Magic Flute") and the finale of Symphony No. 41. In <time datetime="1783">1783</time>, Mozart and his wife visited his family in Salzburg. His father and sister were cordially polite to Constanze, but the visit prompted the composition of one of Mozart's great liturgical pieces, the Mass in C minor. Though not completed, it was premiered in Salzburg, with Constanze singing a solo part.</p>
            <p>With substantial returns from his concerts and elsewhere, Mozart and his wife adopted a more luxurious lifestyle. They moved to an expensive apartment, with a yearly rent of 460 florins. Mozart bought a fine fortepiano from Anton Walter for about 900 florins, and a billiard table for about 300. The Mozarts sent their son Karl Thomas to an expensive boarding school and kept servants. During this period Mozart saved little of his income. On <time datetime="12-14-84">14 December 1784</time>, Mozart became a Freemason, admitted to the lodge Zur Wohltätigkeit ("Beneficence"). Freemasonry played an essential role in the remainder of Mozart's life: he attended meetings, a number of his friends were Masons, and on various occasions, he composed Masonic music, e.g. the Maurerische Trauermusik.</p>

            </figure>
            <p>Despite the great success of Die Entführung aus dem Serail, Mozart did little operatic writing for the next four years, producing only two unfinished works and the one-act Der Schauspieldirektor. He focused instead on his career as a piano soloist and writer of concertos. Around the end of <time datetime="1785">1785</time>, Mozart moved away from keyboard writing and began his famous operatic collaboration with the librettist Lorenzo Da Ponte. The year <time datetime="1786">1786</time> saw the successful premiere of Le nozze di Figaro in Vienna. Its reception in Prague later in the year was even warmer, and this led to a second collaboration with Da Ponte: the opera Don Giovanni, which premiered in October <time datetime="1787">1787</time> to acclaim in Prague, but less success in Vienna during <time datetime="1788">1788</time>. The two are among Mozart's most famous works and are mainstays of operatic repertoire today, though at their premieres their musical complexity caused difficulty both for listeners and for performers. These developments were not witnessed by Mozart's father, who had died on <time datetime="05-28-1787">28 May 1787</time>.</p>
            <p>In December <time datetime="1787">1787</time>, Mozart finally obtained a steady post under aristocratic patronage. Emperor Joseph II appointed him as his "chamber composer", a post that had fallen vacant the previous month on the death of Gluck. It was a part-time appointment, paying just 800 florins per year, and required Mozart only to compose dances for the annual balls in the Redoutensaal (see Mozart and dance). This modest income became important to Mozart when hard times arrived. Court records show that Joseph aimed to keep the esteemed composer from leaving Vienna in pursuit of better prospects.</p>

            <h3><time datetime="1788">1788</time>&ndash;<time datetime="1790">90</time></h3>
            <p>Toward the end of the decade, Mozart's circumstances worsened. Around <time datetime="1786">1786</time> he had ceased to appear frequently in public concerts, and his income shrank. This was a difficult time for musicians in Vienna because of the Austro-Turkish War: both the general level of prosperity and the ability of the aristocracy to support music had declined. In <time datetime="1788">1788</time>, Mozart saw a 66% decline in his income compared to his best years in <time datetime="1781">1781</time>.</p>
            <p>Around this time, Mozart made some long journeys hoping to improve his fortunes, visiting Leipzig, Dresden, and Berlin in the spring of <time datetime="1789"1789></time>, and Frankfurt, Mannheim, and other German cities in <time datetime="1790">1790</time>.</p>
            
            <h3><time datetime="1791">1791</time></h3>
            <p>Mozart's last year was, until his final illness struck, a time of high productivity—and by some accounts, one of personal recovery. He composed a great deal, including some of his most admired works: the opera The Magic Flute; the final piano concerto (K. 595 in B♭); the Clarinet Concerto K. 622; the last in his series of string quintets (K. 614 in E♭); the motet Ave verum corpus K. 618; and the unfinished Requiem K. 626.</p>

            <p>Mozart fell ill while in Prague for the premiere, on <time datetime="09-06-91">6 September 1791</time>, of his opera La clemenza di Tito, which was written in that same year on commission for Emperor Leopold II's coronation festivities.[85] He continued his professional functions for some time and conducted the premiere of The Magic Flute on 30 September. His health deteriorated on 20 November, at which point he became bedridden, suffering from swelling, pain, and vomiting.</p>
            <p>Mozart died in his home on <time datetime="12-05-91">5 December 1791</time>(aged 35) at <time time="12:55 am">12:55 am</time>.</p>
            <blockquote>Mozart was interred in a common grave, in accordance with contemporary Viennese custom, at the St. Marx Cemetery outside the city on <time datetime="12-07-91">7 December</time>. If, as later reports say, no mourners attended, that too is consistent with Viennese burial customs at the time; later Otto Jahn (<time datetime="1856">1856</time>) wrote that Salieri, Süssmayr, van Swieten and two other musicians were present. The tale of a storm and snow is false; the day was calm and mild. --The New Grove</blockquote>
